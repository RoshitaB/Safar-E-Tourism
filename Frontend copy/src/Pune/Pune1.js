Called “Queen of the Deccan,” Pune is the cultural capital of the Maratha peoples. The city first gained importance as the capital of the Bhonsle Marathas in the 17th century. <br/><br/> Pune has long been a major educational and cultural centre; former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru referred to it as the “Oxford and Cambridge of India.” <br/> <br/>   The city is also known for cultural activities such as classical music, spirituality, theatre, sports and literature.   <br/><br/> The city is easy to navigate and is filled with art and history and has a bustling nightlife. Pune has some of India’s most beautiful and eye-catching architecture. A prominent historical landmark in the city is Shaniwarwada, a majestic fort built in 1732 and the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire.
